  Creating machine learning algorithms which use deep density models to detect shifts in distributions as well as determine which feature(s) are causing the shift (i.e. if a sensor/set of sensors in a sensor network are acting anomalous). 
  
  * Developed novel model-based score method test statistic based on Fisher divergence which can compute a conditional test static for all dimensions in a single forward and backward pass of a deep model.
  * Wrote and maintained repository with example code: [*to be released once work is published*]
  * Currently working on characterizing distribution shifts using optimal transport.

  * Identified issues in state-of-the-art computer vision frameworks for detection of COVID-19
  * Built computer vision models to conquer some of these issues, such as being robust to spatialdistribution shifts. The models were trained using Livermoreâ€™s Sierra HPC system.
  * Used Natural Language Processing techniques on parsed Material Science publications to createan interpretable deep model to aid in the synthesis of new nanostructures and nanomaterials.
