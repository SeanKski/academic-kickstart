  Creating machine learning algorithms which use deep density models to detect shifts in distributions 
as well as determine which feature(s) are causing the shift. (i.e. if a sensor/set of sensors in a sensor network are acting anomalous). We are currently working on methods for characterizing such shifts and later adapting.
  
  * Developed novel model-based score method test statistic based on Fisher divergence which can compute a conditional test static for all dimensions in a single forward and backward pass of a deep model.
  * Wrote and maintained repository with example code: [*to be released once work is published*]
  * Currently working on characterizing distribution shifts using optimal transport.
